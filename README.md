# Calcuim-analysis (The publicly available code for learning project)
Calcuim analysis of whole-brain neuronal activities (light-sheet datasets), YuqiZhu, 2025

Including：
(1) Pre process of lightsheet calcium images (averaged template, motor correction, registation, singal extraction);
(2) Analysis of Whole brain neuronal activities (ΔF/F, statistical analysis, dimensionality reduction, decomposion of population activity, clustering, graph-based network analysis and visualization);
(3) RNN-based whole-brian network information flow (to be updated).
